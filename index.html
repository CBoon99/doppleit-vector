Potential Issues / Bugs:

Incomplete SVG Export: The exportCanvas('svg') function seems to be cut off. You'll need to finish the logic for generating the SVG data from your paths array. This will likely involve iterating through the paths and creating the corresponding SVG path elements.
Fill Color and Opacity for Shapes: When drawing shapes, the fill color and opacity are set within the mousemove event. This might cause performance issues if there are a lot of mousemove events during the drawing of a single shape. It would be better to apply the fill properties when the mouseup event finalizes the shape.
Dashed/Dotted Lines on Shapes: The setLineDash for dashed and dotted lines is applied within the mousemove event for shapes as well. Similar to the fill, it might be more efficient to set this once when the shape is finalized.
Undo/Redo Functionality: While you have undoStack and redoStack initialized and you're pushing to the undoStack on mousedown, the actual undo and redo functions are missing. You'll need to implement these functions to manipulate the paths array and redraw the canvas.
"Shape" Tool Logic: The "Shape" tool currently only draws rectangles. If you intend to add other shapes (circles, lines, etc.), you'll need to expand the logic within the mousedown and mousemove event listeners and potentially add more tool buttons.
Error Handling for Image Import: It might be good to add some basic error handling for the image import in case the file is not a valid image or if there's an issue reading the file.
Things That Look Good and Wired Up:

Basic Pen Tool: The pen tool for free-form drawing seems to be working correctly, capturing points and drawing lines.
Color Picker: The color wheel and lightness slider appear to be correctly implemented for selecting and updating the current color. The HEX, HSL, and RGB inputs are also linked.
Swatches: The swatch functionality for storing and selecting colors looks good, including saving to localStorage.
Stroke Width and Opacity: The range inputs for stroke width and opacity are correctly updating the currentPath properties.
Stroke Style: The dropdown for solid, dashed, and dotted stroke styles is correctly updating the currentPath.
Filename Input: The filename input is initialized with a default value.
Image Import (Basic): The basic structure for importing images via file input and drag/drop is in place and should display the image on the canvas.
Drag and Drop: The drag and drop zone visually indicates when a file is being dragged over it.
Event Listeners: All the necessary event listeners for the tools, color picker, canvas interactions, and export buttons seem to be correctly attached.
Redraw Canvas: The redrawCanvas function clears the canvas and redraws all the paths, which is essential for updating the view.
Confirmation:

For the most part, it looks like you have a very solid foundation and the core elements are wired up correctly. The main piece that's missing is the completion of the SVG export and the implementation of the undo/redo functionality. Depending on your plans, you might also want to expand the "Shape" tool and add more robust error handling.
